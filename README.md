## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database


## Installation

To install and set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies using the package manager of your choice.
3. Set up the environment variables for the database name, MySQL username, and password.
4. Run the necessary commands to create and seed the database.
5. Start the server to establish the connection between the back end and the database.

## Usage

Once the project is set up and the server is running, you can use a tool like Insomnia Core to test the functionality of the API. The API routes for categories, products, and tags should return the relevant data in a JSON format. Additionally, you can perform API POST, PUT, and DELETE requests to create, update, and delete data in the database.
